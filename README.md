# Personal Website
This repository is going to host the code for my personal website. I chose to use Vue.js instead of Angular or React.

## Ideas
* Create a Splash Page, Home Page, Resume Page and a Navigation Bar to tie them all together.
* Attempt to host the completed webpage on a services either Apache HTTPD, Tomcat or Node.js.
* Add additional pages to host a photo library for my collection.
* Archive of family photographs from childhood could be very helpful for everyone in my family.
* Adding a login system which uses a database or possibly just FireBase hosted by GCP to allow certain people to access the photo archive.
* Research Flutter as it allows developers to create web pages mobile or desktop as well as iOS and Android apps based on the same codebase which could quite interesting to explore.

## Reason to create this repository and the website
Aside from hosting my resume I have some other objectives that I wish to accomplish with this repository:
* Learn how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript while creating the resume. I have always been hesitant to delve into front-end web development due to a lack of interest and time constraints or most concerningly fear that I may not be able to produce a working product. This is a misnomer as the only way to discover how I will develop the website is to actually develop the website.
* This repository is a very public showcase of my thoughts and ideas on my journey to create the end product. It enables me learn good development practices, creating tickets, describing issues, tracking the progression, creating feature/bug branches, merging changes and much more.
